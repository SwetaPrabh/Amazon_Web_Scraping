This palette was a decent price and I was looking for a few different shades. This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease. The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :) I really can't tell what exactly this thing is. It's not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid. And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face. It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was okay because it lasted me for a long time. I think it does great coverage for the price I paid. It is heavy, and wears off within 30-1hr. It kinda dries your skin. I'd recommend it to people who are just looking for a cheap coverage, or beginners who are just learning to conceal. I was very happy to get this palette, now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is.  In this unnamed set you can do a lot of blending, sculpting, highlighting and concealing.  The product is nicely pigmented, it's smooth and applies well then blends out beautifully. I have normal to dry skin as I'm 59 years, this works wonderfully under my foundation.  I also use a silicone based primer,which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh, dewy look I love.You get a good amount of product for your money here, so this is well worth the cost.  What more can you say, if one is willing to repurchase a product then that says more than mere words. PLEASE DONT DO IT! this just rachett the palette size is not like in the picture, the colors go on sheer, slides on face like wax don't expect  your makeup to stay put with this one. just spend the money for the good stuff. 2 thumbs down Chalky,Not Pigmented,Wears off easily,Not a Coastal Scents Dupe,Too many highlighter colors,Does not show up on dark skinned women.I would not recommend.The coastal scents is currently on sale. It's worth the few extra bucks.\""
